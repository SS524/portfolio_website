            <hr>
            <p>The Gemstone Price Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that forecasts the future prices of various gemstones based on historical data and relevant market indicators.</p>
            <p>By employing advanced algorithms, the system analyzes factors such as gemstone type, carat weight, cut, clarity, color, and market trends to generate accurate predictions. The dataset has been <b>preprocessed</b>, and <b>feature engineering</b> techniques has been applied to enhance model performance. The model is trained using <b>supervised learning</b> methods, validated, and <b>fine-tuned</b> to achieve optimal accuracy. Additionally, <b>data visualization</b> tools has been utilized to gain insights into price patterns and trends.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>The phishing domain detection project utilizes <b>logistic regression</b> with hyperparameter tuning to identify potential phishing domains. It analyzes URL and domain level features to distinguish between legitimate and malicious websites, making it effective in detecting phishing attempts.</p>

            <h3 class="main-subheading">Job Recommendation System</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The project involved diving deep into <b>natural language processing (NLP) </b>to understand and extract valuable information from job descriptions and user preferences. By analyzing the text using NLP techniques, I was able to identify key job attributes and match them with user profiles.</p>
            <p>1️⃣ To make accurate recommendations, I implemented <b>cosine similarity</b>, a famous mathematical measure, to compare the similarities between user preferences and job descriptions. This allowed the system to identify each user's most relevant job opportunities, increasing the chances of finding the perfect fit.</p>
            <p>2️⃣ To provide a seamless user experience, I built a website using <b>Flask</b>, a powerful web framework in Python. By leveraging the render_template module, I created an intuitive and interactive platform where users can input their preferences and receive personalized job recommendations instantly.</p>

            <h3 class="main-subheading">Sentiment Analyzer</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>It is a website, which can be used to check the sentiment of any movie reviews</p>
            <p>1️⃣ To develop this sentiment analyzer, I utilized the renowned IMDB movie review dataset. This dataset contains a vast collection of movie reviews, allowing me to create a robust and accurate model.</p>
            <p>2️⃣ I employed the powerful <b>word2vec</b> technique, which is widely recognized for its ability to capture semantic relationships between words. By training word2vec on my dataset, I ensured that my sentiment analyzer comprehends the intricate nuances of language.</p>
            <p>3️⃣ For the training phase, I implemented an <b>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)</b> model. LSTM is a state-of-the-art deep learning model that excels at analyzing sequential data. Its ability to retain long-term dependencies makes it ideal for understanding the context and sentiment of movie reviews.</p>
            <p>4️⃣ To streamline the development process, I incorporated <b>MLOps</b> tools such as <b>DVC</b>. These tools enable me to efficiently track the status of each pipeline, ensuring that the sentiment analyzer operates effectively and meets our expectations.</p>

            <p>This is an image classifier. I have used the images of three different football players (Messi, Ronaldo, Neymar) to train my model.</p>
            <p>1️⃣ To crop the face from the image, I have used <b>Haar Cascade classifier</b> from open-cv.</p>
            <p>2️⃣ <b>CNN</b> has been used in training the model</p>
